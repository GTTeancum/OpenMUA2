# MUA2 CANONICAL HANDOFF — Wii Marvel: Ultimate Alliance 2 native PC recompilation

**Project:** Wii Marvel: Ultimate Alliance 2 USA (RMSE52) native-PC recompilation  
**Repository:** `GTTeancum/OpenMUA2`  
**Canonical branch:** `main`  
**Date:** 2026-09-25

## Mandatory workflow

- GitHub `main` is authoritative; inspect it before editing.
- **Multiplatform performance is the active priority.**
- Preserve SMC/hash/audit/REL eligibility/verification protections.
- Use moderately short turns because resume-stream failures occur: one focused merge/implementation plus validation, then update/attach this handoff.
- At the end of every turn, update this file, commit it to `main`, and attach `MUA2-CANONICAL-HANDOFF.md` in chat.
- Never commit proprietary RMSE52 data, extracted files, generated proprietary translation output, saves, logs, screenshots, or RAM captures.
- RMSE52 game assets are now verified persistent in `/MUA2/RMSE52-Game-Files/Extracted`; restore working copies under `.local/game` from the 10 `RMSE52-extracted.tar.NNN` chunks. The original split uploads are no longer required for normal continuation.
- Never claim FPS/gameplay validation without an actual RMSE52 run.

## Latest accepted work — PR #22

PR #22 `Remove redundant module-active burst check` is **MERGED**.

Merge commit:

- `dc43d362d425134222d00aa02dd4dbec99fcf222`

Behavior:

- Removes the explicit `m_module_active &&` from the native burst back-edge.
- `fast_native_continue()` already rejects inactive modules on both paths:
  - REL/forced-fallback path: `FastDispatchableAt() -> ChunkIndexOf()` rejects `!m_module_active`.
  - direct lookup path: rejects `!m_module_active || m_chunk_lookup_table.empty()`.
- Host-call, downcount, CPU-state, exception, timing, and dispatchability behavior remain unchanged.

Validation:

- OpenMUA2 tooling run `36047001104`: PASS on Ubuntu + Windows.
- ModernGekko run `36047001119`: standalone + full build/test PASS on Ubuntu + Windows, including MSVC/Ninja.

## Latest accepted work — PR #23

PR #23 `Skip empty forced-fallback scan in interpreter path` is **MERGED**.

Merge commit:

- `20dd90851c3a2625ddb973f8850e2494bb33ca9f`

Behavior:

- Extends PR #19's empty forced-fallback-range short circuit to the interpreter/fallback branch in `Run()`.
- When `m_forced_fallback_ranges` is empty, the fallback path no longer calls `IsForcedFallbackAddress(ppc.pc)`.
- Configured forced-fallback ranges retain the exact prior behavior.
- Native dispatch, REL, SMC, host-call, timing, and exception semantics are unchanged.

Validation:

- OpenMUA2 tooling run `36055136834`: PASS on Ubuntu + Windows.
- ModernGekko run `36055136817`: standalone + full build/test PASS on Ubuntu + Windows, including MSVC/Ninja.

## Historical RMSE52 performance boundary

Historical accepted native-REL run, predating recent optimizations:

- reported FPS ~`10.319`
- guest-frame FPS ~`2.062`
- speed ~`0.1404`
- native dispatches `174,476,293`
- native exceptions `5,959`
- hook fallback `1,299,055`
- hook fast cache `1,295,291`
- hook slow `3,764`
- JIT fallback runs `11,023`

This proves native REL progression, **not current performance**.

## Latest accepted work — PR #24

PR #24 `Reuse generated linked result on burst continuation` is **MERGED**.

Merge commit:

- `de411096f5986980ac58e1f3a7373d8f5351dc67`

Behavior:

- Preserves the linked PC returned by generated dispatch while keeping `m_guest.pc` in runtime form for host-side semantics.
- `TranslateRelAddress()` reports the active REL section selected during linked→runtime translation.
- `FastDispatchableLinkedAt()` uses a preserved linked result for the next verified chunk lookup when its invariants hold, avoiding the normal runtime→linked conversion.
- Forced-fallback and exact host-call checks remain on the runtime address.
- REL chunks must still belong to the resolved active REL section; DOL chunks require the non-REL sentinel.
- Lockstep-checked blocks and native exception returns disable preserved-result reuse.
- Any direct-linked eligibility miss falls back to `FastDispatchableAt() -> ResolveNativeAddress() -> RefreshRelSections()`.

Validation:

- OpenMUA2 tooling run `36071914753`: **PASS on Ubuntu + Windows**.
- ModernGekko run `36071914841`: **PASS all four jobs**:
  - standalone Windows: PASS;
  - standalone Ubuntu: PASS;
  - full Windows build/test: PASS;
  - full Ubuntu build/test: PASS.
- No RMSE52 game-side FPS claim is made from CI.

## Latest accepted work — PR #25

PR #25 `Check cheap burst termination before continuation lookup` is **MERGED**.

Merge commit:

- `d3aeab80a3ae44c2d18265ad9f1e5868bf369e50`

Behavior:

- Reorders the native burst back-edge to check `ppc.downcount > 0` and CPU running state before `fast_native_continue()`.
- When the burst must already terminate, it skips one chunk/REL/host-call continuation eligibility probe.
- When the burst can continue, the existing `fast_native_continue()` path is unchanged.
- Synchronous/external exception breaks remain before the back-edge condition.
- Skipped REL refresh and lazy host-call-cache population are eligibility/cache work only and are re-established on the next eligible entry.

Validation:

- OpenMUA2 tooling run `36074380247`: **PASS on Ubuntu + Windows**.
- ModernGekko run `36074380288`: **PASS all four jobs**:
  - standalone Windows: PASS;
  - standalone Ubuntu: PASS;
  - full Windows build/test: PASS;
  - full Ubuntu build/test: PASS.
- No RMSE52 game-side FPS claim is made from CI.

Status doc:

## Latest accepted work — PR #27

PR #27 `Check fallback termination before dispatch probes` is **MERGED**.

Merge commit:

- `b78431f21625ad61b4f66855f5f94b859f04cf7a`

Behavior:

- Reorders the interpreter-only fallback loop so `ppc.downcount > 0` and CPU running state are checked before `DispatchableAt(ppc.pc)` and `IsHostCallAddress(ppc.pc)`.
- An exhausted/stopped fallback slice no longer performs chunk verification, REL eligibility refresh, or an exact host-call lookup only to discover that it cannot continue.
- If the slice can continue, the same dispatchability and host-call stop conditions still run before another interpreted instruction.
- `IsHostCallAddress()` is read-only.
- Deferred `DispatchableAt()` work is eligibility preparation only; after a downcount exit the next outer-loop entry runs `core_timing.Advance()` and checks dispatchability before any native execution. After CPU stop there is no next execution to prepare.
- Forced-fallback, exception delivery, timing, SMC/hash protection, lockstep, and native re-entry semantics otherwise remain unchanged.

Validation:

- OpenMUA2 tooling run `36130494685`: **PASS on Ubuntu + Windows**.
- ModernGekko run `36130494695`: **PASS all four jobs**:
  - standalone Windows: PASS;
  - standalone Ubuntu: PASS;
  - full Windows build/test: PASS;
  - full Ubuntu build/test: PASS.
- No RMSE52 game-side FPS claim is made from CI.

Status doc:

- `c1ee8eba08ba06d2a08b687e26a8615f5c63ebfc` — `Record merged fallback termination ordering`

## Latest accepted work — PR #28

PR #28 `Reuse native entry host-call result` is **MERGED**.

Merge commit:

- `7b11a1869c85aec8d5384c7f044779454e37a69f`

Behavior:

- Splits native-entry eligibility into `entry_dispatchable` and `entry_host_call`.
- `entry_host_call` is evaluated only after `DispatchableAt()` succeeds and retains the same candidate-chunk coverage plus exact-address `host_call_at()` semantics.
- If the otherwise-dispatchable entry is rejected because it is an exact host call, the fallback branch reuses `entry_host_call` rather than immediately calling `IsHostCallAddress(ppc.pc)` again for the same PC.
- If the module is inactive or `DispatchableAt()` fails, the fallback branch still performs the original direct `m_guest.host_call && IsHostCallAddress(ppc.pc)` check.
- Host-call handling, LR JIT invalidation, passthrough state, timing, forced-fallback, SMC/hash, lockstep, and exception behavior are unchanged.

Validation:

- Initial OpenMUA2 tooling run `36142577297`: failed only because an older host-call gate regression still expected inline `!host_call_at(ppc.pc, entry_chunk_index)`.
- Updated that stale source-string regression without changing runtime behavior; current PR head became `8aba565403be5607bbfb9fa902f3ea82ef2394fa`.
- Current-head OpenMUA2 tooling run `36142703033`: **PASS on Ubuntu + Windows**.
- Superseded ModernGekko run `36142577241` was cancelled by workflow concurrency after the test-only head update.
- Current-head ModernGekko run `36142703037`: **PASS all four jobs**:
  - standalone Windows: PASS;
  - standalone Ubuntu: PASS;
  - full Windows build/test: PASS;
  - full Ubuntu build/test: PASS.
- No RMSE52 game-side FPS claim is made from CI.

Status doc:

- `fa6dde0c484903e9e9bfabf024af22f0569991c3` — `Record merged native-entry host-call reuse`

## Current blockers

1. RMSE52 assets are persistent and verified; **re-upload is not required**.
2. The restored persistent tar is complete but its Wii non-filesystem metadata is stored under `disc-meta/`, which is not directly bootable by Dolphin's extracted-disc reader. A private working copy must restore Dolphin's expected compatibility layout before runtime tests:
   - copy `disc-meta/ticket.bin`, `tmd.bin`, `cert.bin`, and `h3.bin` to the game root;
   - create `disc/header.bin` from bytes `0x000000-0x0000FF` of `disc-meta/disc-header.bin`;
   - create `disc/region.bin` from bytes `0x04E000-0x04E01F` of `disc-meta/disc-header.bin`.
3. Shell GitHub checkout remains blocked by container DNS, but this is no longer a hard blocker: ModernGekko CI now retains a Linux runtime/build kit artifact containing the tested runner, Sys data, current DolRecomp/module-build sources, tooling, and tests.
4. A fresh **current-main native-REL game-side baseline** is still required before accepting another performance micro-optimization.

## Next exact turn

1. Check ModernGekko CI run `36206182149` for commit `29e567630abf5f12e6854256c9ca8f6954b1a0d8`.
2. When the Linux full-build/test job is green, download/materialize its `moderngekko-linux-<sha>` artifact.
3. Build current DolRecomp locally from the retained kit.
4. Regenerate RMSE52:
   - DOL from the verified `sys/main.dol`;
   - REL with `--rel-base 0x80E4A080 --rel-bss-base 0x811BCAC0 --cpu broadway --backend c`.
5. Merge DOL + REL generated output with `tools/merge_mua2_generated.py` using the retained verified live REL audit; build the current 524-chunk module and run the native module audit.
6. Run the current-main Linux runner against the metadata-fixed private RMSE52 tree under Xvfb/llvmpipe and establish the fresh baseline.
7. Capture at minimum:
   - reported FPS / guest-frame FPS / speed;
   - native dispatch count/rate and average burst length if available;
   - JIT/interpreter fallback counts;
   - host-call checks/fallbacks;
   - native exception counts;
   - hottest dispatch PCs / profiler data if instrumentation is enabled.
8. Update `docs/CURRENT-STATUS.md` and this handoff with the measured current-main baseline.
9. Only then resume the next source-level performance target.

## Last turn update — 2026-09-25

What happened:

- Reused the verified persistent RMSE52 game tree; critical hashes remain:
  - `sys/main.dol`: `0857973ed7646eaf1294981295673243546c935cdbd1fd07345b4d1093c62741`;
  - `files/Marvel-rev-fin-plf2.rel`: `5b739b1046b6987897f078c27f54c214cfe7a1b0381bca0ee29754b57c8a6a7f`.
- Confirmed Xvfb and `xvfb-run` are available in the current container. The earlier “no X11 host” conclusion was environment/setup-specific, not a permanent container limitation.
- Reproduced the zero-dispatch failure in both headless and X11/OGL modes with the restored tree. The runtime loaded RMSE52 and the native module but shut down immediately after `Booting from disc`.
- Root cause was identified in Dolphin `DirectoryBlob.cpp`: the persistent restore stores Wii partition metadata under `disc-meta/`, while Dolphin expects `ticket.bin`, `tmd.bin`, `cert.bin`, and `h3.bin` at the partition root plus `disc/header.bin` and `disc/region.bin`.
- Reconstructed those compatibility files **only in the private working copy**. No proprietary source asset or stored persistent archive was modified.
- After that metadata-layout repair, the same preserved MG01 graphical runner genuinely entered RMSE52 guest execution:
  - apploader initialized;
  - game reported `Main as started`;
  - GX/VI initialized;
  - existing SMC/hash protection remained active and reported the historical protected-chunk mismatch/fallback behavior;
  - live REL base was reported as `0x80E4A080`;
  - automation status reached `state=running` with frames/presents advancing.
- The native dispatch trace reached at least `18,874,368` dispatches during this early control run, proving guest/native execution is restored.
- The control run was terminated by the outer harness/Xvfb timeout before a clean runtime shutdown, so its transient FPS/speed/status values are **not** accepted as a performance baseline.
- Added reusable CI artifact retention:
  - `b3ff95f0270d0ba9700164d38ee2f61525051f56` — retain Linux runtime kit;
  - `29e567630abf5f12e6854256c9ca8f6954b1a0d8` — include current tooling/tests in that kit.
- ModernGekko CI run `36206182149` was active at the end of this turn. Standalone Ubuntu and Windows tests had passed; full Ubuntu/Windows build-test jobs were still running.
- The artifact path is intended to bypass the container's shell GitHub DNS limitation and provide the exact current-main runner/source pieces needed for the fresh RMSE52 native-REL baseline.
- No new current-main FPS/speed claim is made yet.
