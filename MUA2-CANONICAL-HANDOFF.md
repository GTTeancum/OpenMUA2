# MUA2 CANONICAL HANDOFF — Wii Marvel: Ultimate Alliance 2 native PC recompilation

**Project:** Wii Marvel: Ultimate Alliance 2 USA (RMSE52) native-PC recompilation  
**Repository:** `GTTeancum/OpenMUA2`  
**Canonical branch:** `main`  
**Date:** 2026-09-24

## Mandatory workflow

- GitHub `main` is authoritative; inspect it before editing.
- **Multiplatform performance is the active priority.**
- Preserve SMC/hash/audit/REL eligibility/verification protections.
- Use moderately short turns because resume-stream failures occur: one focused merge/implementation plus validation, then update/attach this handoff.
- At the end of every turn, update this file, commit it to `main`, and attach `MUA2-CANONICAL-HANDOFF.md` in chat.
- Never commit proprietary RMSE52 data, extracted files, generated proprietary translation output, saves, logs, screenshots, or RAM captures.
- Never claim FPS/gameplay validation without an actual RMSE52 run.

## Latest accepted work — PR #22

PR #22 `Remove redundant module-active burst check` is **MERGED**.

Merge commit:

- `dc43d362d425134222d00aa02dd4dbec99fcf222`

Behavior:

- Removes the explicit `m_module_active &&` from the native burst back-edge.
- `fast_native_continue()` already rejects inactive modules on both paths:
  - REL/forced-fallback path: `FastDispatchableAt() -> ChunkIndexOf()` rejects `!m_module_active`.
  - direct lookup path: rejects `!m_module_active || m_chunk_lookup_table.empty()`.
- Host-call, downcount, CPU-state, exception, timing, and dispatchability behavior remain unchanged.

Validation:

- OpenMUA2 tooling run `36047001104`: PASS on Ubuntu + Windows.
- ModernGekko run `36047001119`: standalone + full build/test PASS on Ubuntu + Windows, including MSVC/Ninja.

Status doc:

- `039782520c25933f7c6653797332bd7e8d0715cd` — `Record merged module-active burst cleanup`

## Latest accepted work — PR #23

PR #23 `Skip empty forced-fallback scan in interpreter path` is **MERGED**.

Merge commit:

- `20dd90851c3a2625ddb973f8850e2494bb33ca9f`

Behavior:

- Extends PR #19's empty forced-fallback-range short circuit to the interpreter/fallback branch in `Run()`.
- When `m_forced_fallback_ranges` is empty, the fallback path no longer calls `IsForcedFallbackAddress(ppc.pc)`.
- Configured forced-fallback ranges retain the exact prior behavior.
- Native dispatch, REL, SMC, host-call, timing, and exception semantics are unchanged.

Validation:

- OpenMUA2 tooling run `36055136834`: PASS on Ubuntu + Windows.
- ModernGekko run `36055136817`: standalone + full build/test PASS on Ubuntu + Windows, including MSVC/Ninja.

Status doc:

- `2de1dee811932d3d010dc606abf02cb7ab749769` — `Record merged interpreter fallback fast path`

## Historical RMSE52 performance boundary

Historical accepted native-REL run, predating recent optimizations:

- reported FPS ~`10.319`
- guest-frame FPS ~`2.062`
- speed ~`0.1404`
- native dispatches `174,476,293`
- native exceptions `5,959`
- hook fallback `1,299,055`
- hook fast cache `1,295,291`
- hook slow `3,764`
- JIT fallback runs `11,023`

This proves native REL progression, **not current performance**.

## Latest accepted work — PR #24

PR #24 `Reuse generated linked result on burst continuation` is **MERGED**.

Merge commit:

- `de411096f5986980ac58e1f3a7373d8f5351dc67`

Behavior:

- Preserves the linked PC returned by generated dispatch while keeping `m_guest.pc` in runtime form for host-side semantics.
- `TranslateRelAddress()` reports the active REL section selected during linked→runtime translation.
- `FastDispatchableLinkedAt()` uses a preserved linked result for the next verified chunk lookup when its invariants hold, avoiding the normal runtime→linked conversion.
- Forced-fallback and exact host-call checks remain on the runtime address.
- REL chunks must still belong to the resolved active REL section; DOL chunks require the non-REL sentinel.
- Lockstep-checked blocks and native exception returns disable preserved-result reuse.
- Any direct-linked eligibility miss falls back to `FastDispatchableAt() -> ResolveNativeAddress() -> RefreshRelSections()`.

Validation:

- OpenMUA2 tooling run `36071914753`: **PASS on Ubuntu + Windows**.
- ModernGekko run `36071914841`: **PASS all four jobs**:
  - standalone Windows: PASS;
  - standalone Ubuntu: PASS;
  - full Windows build/test: PASS;
  - full Ubuntu build/test: PASS.
- No RMSE52 game-side FPS claim is made from CI.

Status doc:

- `1256b9ff7e59dd48750fdc93ebcfec63a900ab22` — `Record merged linked continuation fast path`

## Current blockers

1. **Game-performance gate:** this environment does not have the proprietary RMSE52 workspace/image, so current FPS cannot be measured here.
2. There is no current source/CI integration blocker after PR #24.

## Next exact turn

1. Inspect current `main` after PR #24 and the status/handoff commits.
2. Implement one focused multiplatform performance change at the native burst back-edge:
   - current order calls `fast_native_continue(...)` before checking `ppc.downcount > 0` and `*state_ptr == CPU::State::Running`;
   - reorder the cheap termination checks ahead of `fast_native_continue()` so a burst that must already exit does not perform another chunk/REL/host-call eligibility probe.
3. Before accepting the change, prove the skipped continuation probe has no required end-of-burst side effect:
   - any lazy host-call-state discovery can safely occur on the next eligible entry;
   - any REL refresh/resolution can safely occur on the next entry;
   - forced-fallback, exception, timing, and CPU-state behavior remain unchanged.
4. Add a focused source regression pinning the cheap-check-first back-edge order.
5. Run OpenMUA2 tooling CI and ModernGekko Windows/Ubuntu validation; merge only if green.
6. Update/attach this handoff and stop.
7. Do not claim FPS improvement without a fresh RMSE52 benchmark.

## Last turn update — 2026-09-24

What happened:

- Stayed on the PR #24 integration gate until the full matrix completed rather than ending another short turn mid-build.
- OpenMUA2 tooling run `36071914753`: PASS on Ubuntu + Windows.
- ModernGekko run `36071914841`: PASS all four jobs, including full MSVC/Ninja Windows and full Ubuntu build/test.
- Merged PR #24 as `de411096f5986980ac58e1f3a7373d8f5351dc67`.
- Updated `docs/CURRENT-STATUS.md` in `1256b9ff7e59dd48750fdc93ebcfec63a900ab22`.
- While CI was running, inspected the remaining native burst back-edge and identified the next source-level candidate: check `ppc.downcount` and CPU running state before `fast_native_continue()` so an already-terminating burst skips one eligibility/REL/host-call probe.
- No second runtime patch was started before PR #24 cleared.
- No RMSE52 game-side run occurred.
